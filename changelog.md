## 0.0.35 - 0.0.38 - Custom Species Editor
### Features
* Added new Custom Species Editor which can be found in the System Settings tab next to the system name.
* [MACRO BREAKING] Changed CustomSpecies to now be a seperate entity instead of being combined into the Base Species pool.
### Bugfixes
* Fixed issues created by Hotfix 0.0.34
* Fixed issues where custom species data wouldn't load in properly
  * This may still occur if no GM is in the game, but should fix itself instantly upon a GM joining the game.
### Notes
* This update requires a GM to load into the game for migrations to apply properly. Players may face errors if they join before any GM has joined, and will have to reload to fix those issues after a GM has loaded the game for the first time.
* Old CustomSpecies data will be migrated over automatically. After migration feel free to delete the old json file as it's no longer being used.

## 0.0.34 - Hotfix: Stab Modifier
* Fixed stab modifier not applying properly.
* Update Foundry Version to 0.7.7

## 0.0.33 - Shortcuts!

## 0.0.32 - Move System Overhaul
* 'To-Hit' and 'Damage' messages now have a custom layout.
* Added a new dialog when using a Move
    * Perform Move: Rolls To-Hit & Damage and displays it in the chat
    * Show Details: Shows detailed information about the move to the chat
    * Roll Damage: Only roll Damage, with the option to roll Critical Damage
* Added a Changelog so people actually know what is happening when I post an update!
