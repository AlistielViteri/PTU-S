## Links & Recommendations
- This system was build with [The Furnace](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/fvtt-module-furnace) in mind. 
    - While the system completely functions without it, we recommend installing it for a better experience!
- [Quick Insert](https://gitlab.com/fvtt-modules-lab/quick-insert) is an amazing addon that allows you to drag & drop all over the place even more easily. We 1000% recommend using their module in conjuncture with our system!
