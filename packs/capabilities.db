{"name":"Marsupial","system":{"name":"Marsupial","origin":"","effect":"Kangaskhan is always born with the Baby Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting 5 from each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan have the Baby Template, they live in their mother’s pouch and will not willingly leave it for long; their bond is so strong, that both Pokémon are able to be captured in a single Pokeball during this time. While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside their mother’s pouch while she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources and give that Experience to the baby instead. Once a Baby Kangaskhan reaches level 25 and loses the Baby Template, it exits its mother’s pouch permanently. If its mother had a loyalty higher than 1, it will allow itself to be easily caught by its Trainer.","snippet":"","useCount":0},"type":"capability","img":"/systems/ptu/css/images/icons/capability_icon.png","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"DsHOL7PqMABKgssN":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"ptu","systemVersion":"3.2.3.8","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1683367823333,"modifiedTime":1683367875252,"lastModifiedBy":"DsHOL7PqMABKgssN"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"zLjFQNI0t00tM9DQ"}
